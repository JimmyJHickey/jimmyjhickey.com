Hi, I'm Jimmy Hickey. I received my PhD in Statistics at North Carolina State University. My research focuses on developing new methods in transfer learning and time-to-event machine learning. You can view my <a href="/files/Jimmy_Hickey_resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume here</a> here or even my whole dang <a href="/files/Jimmy_Hickey_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV here</a>.
You can see some of my programming misadventures in the [projects section](projects) and in the [posts section](posts/post_archive) you will mostly see my old homework solutions (let me know if you find any typos!).

## Hobbies
* Hitting tennis balls into nets
* Frantically trying to speed run the New York Times Mini Crossword
* Spending more time automating something than it would take to complete the task
* Making one move blunders in chess

## My more politically charged opinions
* 0 based indexing > 1 based indexing
* Dark theme > Light theme
* Oxford comma > No Oxford comma
* 0.5mm pencils > 0.9mm pencils
* $E(X)^2$ is super ambiguous. Is it $E(X^2)$ or $[E(X)]^2$?! Looking at you, Casella and Berger.
