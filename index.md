Hi, I'm Jimmy Hickey. I'm a statistics PhD student at North Carolina State University. You can view my <a href="/files/Jimmy_Hickey_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV here</a> and [my research here](research) and more about me as a person below. In the [posts section](posts/post_archive) you will mostly see my homework solutions (let me know if you find any typos!). You can see some of my programming misadventures in the [projects section](projects).

## Hobbies
* Hitting tennis balls into nets
* Frantically trying to speed run the New York Times Mini Crossword
* Spending more time automating something than it would take to complete the task
* Reading, realizing I didn't retain anything from the last page, then re-reading

## My more politically charged opinions
* 0 based indexing > 1 based indexing
* Dark theme > Light theme
* Monospace > Variable-width
* Oxford comma > No Oxford comma
* $E[(X)^2] \neq E(X)^2$
* $E[(X)^2] = E[X^2] > $ expectation of open parenthesis X squared close parenthesis $ > E(X)^2 > EX^2$
