# 1.2
**Two six-sided dice are thrown sequentially, and the face values that come up are recorded.**

## a.
**List the sample space.**

$$
    \begin{align}
        \Omega =  \{ & 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, \\
             & 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, \\
             & 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, \\
             & 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, \\
             & 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, \\
             & 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 \}
    \end{align}
$$

## b.
**List the elements that make up the following events:**

### (1)
**$A=$ the sum of the two values is at least 5** 

$$
    \begin{align}
        A = \{ & 14, 15, 16, \\
            & 23, 24, 25, 26, \\
            & 32, 33, 34, 45, 36, \\
            & 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, \\
            & 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, \\
            & 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 \}
    \end{align}
$$

### (2) 
**$B=$ the value of the first die is higher than the value of the second**


$$
    \begin{align}
        B = \{ & 21, \\
            & 31, 32, \\
            & 41, 42, 43, \\
            & 51, 52, 53, 54, \\
            & 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 \}
    \end{align}
$$

### (3)
**$C=$ the first value is 4**

$$
    C = \{ 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 \}
$$

## c.
*List the elements of the following events*

### (1)
*$A \cap C$*

$$
    A \cap C = \{41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 \}
$$

### (2)
*$B \cup C$*

$$
    \begin{align}
        B \cup C = \{ & 21, \\
            & 31, 32, \\
            & 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, \\
            & 51, 52, 53, 54, \\
            & 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 \}
    \end{align}
$$

### (3)
*$A \cap (B \cup C)$*

$$
 \begin{align}
    A \cap (B \cup C)  = &  \\
    
    = & \begin{Bmatrix} 
            14, & 15, & 16, \\

# 1.4
**Draw Venn diagrams to illustrate De Morgan's laws:**

Note: The Red indicates the expressed region.

$$(A \cup B)^{C} = A^{C} \cap B^{C}$$

![Only the region outside of both venn diagrams is shaded](../img/post_img/2019-05-19-ST501-Set-Theory-and-Probability-Homework/4a.png)

$$(A \cap B)^{C} = A^{C} \cup B^{C} $$

![The region outside of both venn diagrams as well as the unshared regions in the venn diagram are shaded](../img/post_img/2019-05-19-ST501-Set-Theory-and-Probability-Homework/4b.png)

# 1.6

*Verify the following extension of the addition rule (a) by an appropriate Venn diagram and (b) by a formal argument using the axioms of probability and teh propositions in this chapter.*

$$ P(A \cup B \cup C) =  P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)$$

## a.

## b.

$$
    \begin{align}
        P(A \cup B \cup C) & =  P(A \cup (B \cup C)) \\
            & = P(A) + P(B \cup C) - P(A \cap (B \cup C)) \\
            & = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - P(A \cap (B \cup C)) \\
            & = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - P( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)) \\
            & = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C) - (P(A \cap B) + P( A \cap C) - P(A \cap B \cap C)) \\
            &Â = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)
