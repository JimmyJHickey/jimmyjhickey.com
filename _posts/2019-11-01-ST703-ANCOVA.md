Problems: 1, 2, 3, 4


# 1
**We considered the posttest scores of children who received one of three therapies.**

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 z + E
$$


## b
**Write the reduced model under $H_{0 \tau} : \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$.**


## d
**In what way does the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2$ differ from $H_{0 \tau}$.**


## e
**Write the reduced model under $H_0$.**



## f
**Given that the model sum of square for the reduced model in (e) is 3282.6955, test the null hypothesis $H_0$ and write conclusions.**



# 2
**In a study, four bags of ten oysters each were randomly placed at each of five locations in the cooling water canal of a poewr plant. Table 12.4 gives the initial and final (one month later) weights of the oyster bags in the five environments.**


## a
**Write an analysis of covariance model for predicting the final weight as a function of the treatment and initial weight. Clearly describe the assumptions you are making and explain how the parameters in the model can be interpreted.**



## b
**For each of the five locations, determine the equation for predicting the final ewight as a function of the intial weight.**


## c
**Calculate the adjusted means for comparing the effects of locations on the fianl weights of the oysters. Compare the adjusted means with the corresponding unadjusted means and give an intuitive explaination for the pattern of adjustments.**

## d
**Construct a 90% confidence interval for tha expected difference between the fianl weight of oysters who have the same initial weight but are grown in two different locations -- location 1 and location 5. What conclusions can be drawn from this interval?**



## f
**Perform a statistical test to see if differences in the initial weight are associated with difference in the final weight.**


## g
**Construct a 95% confidence interval for a parameter that measures the association in (f). On the basis of this interval, what can you say about the initial weight as a predictor of the final weight?**


## h
**Construct a 95% confidence loewr prediction bound for the final weight of a bag of oysters with an intial weight of 25 in location 3. Interpret this lower bound.**

# 3
**Test the adequacy of the simple linear regression model in which the mean soil water content is linear in depth. Which model would oyu select, the linear regression model of the one-factor classification model with 4 treatment means?**


# 4
**Consider designing an experiment to evaluate the potential effectiveness of $t=5$ weight reducing agents. Suppose that $n$ subjects are to be assigned at random to each of $t=5$ treatment groups. Suppose that the smallest meaningful effect on weight loss that researchers involved in the study would like to detect is one which the variance among the weight loss treatment means is at least as great as those given in the alternative below.**


$$
H_1: \mu_1 = \mu_5 = 12,\ \mu_2 = 11, \ \mu_3 = 10, \ \mu_4 = 9.
$$

**Suppose further that the standard deviation among weight losses for any treatment group is about $\sigma = 1$. Hold the type I error rate at $\alpha = 0.05$.**

## a
**Compute the number of subjects necessary to obtain a powr of at least $1 - \beta = 0.9$.**



## b
**Obtain a plot of the power agasint sample sizes between 2 and 10.**



## c
**Describe how the power would change if $\sigma$ were actually larger.**



## d
**Describe how the power would chagne if the population mean weight gain for agent 1 were $\mu_1 = 15$.**



## e
**Suppose that $n=10$ is adopted, and data are obeserved as given in the table below.**

### i
**Carry out a test for the hypothesis that the treatment has no effect on weigh loss. Use $\alpha = 0.05$.**



## ii
**After carrying out all pairwise comparisons at a familywise error rate $\alpha = 0.05$, identify which differences are significant. Be clear about which multiple comparison procedur you use.**
