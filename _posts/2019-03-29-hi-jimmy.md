Hi and welcome to my website! I'm Jimmy Hickey. I'm a computer programmer, a hopeful statistician/data scientist, and a future PhD student. 


This site is a home for info about me, my resum√©, my programming projects, and blog posts that nobody asked for. I plan to write about what I learn in my future courses and on my own. I'll try to remember to check my work and run my spell checker before posting, but if you see any issues, please feel free to contact me using the information in the sidebar.


Hopefully I'll see you in the future!
