# 1
**Consider the dataset from class where grade (%) is modeled as a function of both IQ and
study time (hours). Fit the non-additive multiple linear regression model with explanatory
variables IQ, Time, and time*IQ.**

## (a)
**Estimate the (partial) slope for Time when IQ=100 and also when IQ=101.**


## (b)
**Report standard errors for the two slopes estimated in (a).**


## (c) 
**Estimate the difference in slopes for Time as IQ is contrasted from IQ=100 to IQ=110.**


## (d)
**Report a standard error for the difference estimated in (c).**


## (e)
**Consider a comparison of this full model with the simple linear regression on Time alone. Formally compare these models at level $\alpha = 0.05$. Include a statement of full and reduced models, a null hypothesis, an F-ratio, and a p-value.**

# 2
**When the quadratic model**

$$
Y= \beta_0+\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \beta_4 x_1^2 + \beta_5 x_2^2 + E
$$

**is fitted to the hospital stress data in Exercise 11.12, a residual sum of squares $SS[E]=339,971.7162$ is obtained.**


## (a)
**Given that the total sum of squares does not depend on the assumed model, calculate the regression sum of squares for the quadratic model.**


## (b)
**Set up the ANOVA table showing the degrees of freedom, the sum of squares, and the mean squares associated with the quadratic model.**

## (c)
**Test the null hypothesis $H_0:\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = \beta_4 = \beta_5 = 0$ and write your conclusions.**


## (d)
**Calculate the extra regression sum of squares $R(\beta_3,\beta_4,\beta_5|\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2)$ and interpret this number.**


## (e)
**Test the null hypothesis H$_0:\beta_3=\beta_4=\beta_5=0$ and write your conclusions.**


## (f) 
**Calculate the extra regression sum of squares $R(\beta_4,\beta_5|\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3)$ and interpret this number.**


## (g) 
**Test the null hypothesis $H_0:\beta_4=\beta_5=0$ and write your conclusions.**



# 3
**In an observational study to assess the effects of menopause on cholesterol levels, a researcher measured the cholesterol levels of women in seven menopausal groups. The sample means, standard deviations, and the numbers of women in each group are as follows:**


**Note that the women were not randomly assigned to groups; they were served without experimental manipulation. Accordingly, this is an observational study. The objectives and hypotheses of interest, however , were similar to those of an experimental study with a one-way completely randomized design. For example, the investigator wanted to know whether the average of the means of the first six groups was equal to the mean of the last group; methods of testing such contrasts will be presented in Chapter 9. Using the summary statistics in the table, perform an ANOVA test to see if there are any differences between the mean cholestrol levels of the seven groups.**

# 4
**Refer to the insulin release data in Exercise 8.3.**


## (a)
**Construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected insulin release at each of the three glucose concentrations. Interpret the confidence intervals you construct.**


## (b)
**Perform a hypothesis test to see if the data support the claim that the mean insulin release at high glucose concentration is at least one unit more than that at medium glucose concentration.**



## (c)
**Perform the hypothesis test in (b) using the confidence interval approach. Interpret the interval you construct.**



## (d)
**Let $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, and $\mu_3$ denote, respectively, the expected amount of insulin release at low, medium, and high glucose concentrations. Construct two contrasts such that one measure the difference between the expected releases at low and medium concentrations, while the other measure the difference between the expected release at high concentration and the average of the expected releases at low and medium concentrations.**


## (e)
**Check whether the contrasts you constructed in (d) are orthogonal.**


## (f)
**Test the significance of the contrasts in (d). Write the corresponding conclusions.**


## (g)
**Do the sum of squares for the contrasts in (d) subdivide the treatment sum of squares into single degree of freedom sum of squares? Explain.**


# 5
**Refer to the chemical influx data given in Example 10.3**

## (a)
**Using a simple linear regression model for Y=chemical influx as a function of $X=\log d$, construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected chemical influx when the drug dose is 100nM. Interpret the interval.**

## (b)
**Use the data to verify the claim that quadrupling the drug dose ($d_2/d_1=4$) will result in an increase in chemical influx of more than 5 nmol/mg protein. Answer this question using both hypothesis testing and confidence-interval approaches.**

## (c)
**Use a one-way ANOVA model (see Exercise 10.1) to construct the 95% confidence interval for the expected chemical influx when the drug dose is 100nM. Compare this interval with the interval obtained in (a).**


## (e)
**Use the simple linear regression model to construct a 99% lower bound to the mean chemical influx for the population of all rats receiving a drug dose 10nM. Interpret this result.**


## (f)
**On the basis of a simple linear regression model, perform a statistical test to see if the data suggest that drug does and chemical influx are associated.**


## (g)
**Do the data support the claim that, on average, rats receiving a dose $d=1$ will have a chemical influx of less than 25nM?**



# 6
**Refer to the chemical influx data in Example 10.3.**


## (a)
**Set up the ANOVA tables for simple linear regression analysis:**


### (i)
**with $Y=$ chemical influx as the dependent variable and X=d as the independent variable;**


### (ii) 
**with $Y=$ chemical influx as the dependent variable and $X= \log d$ as the independent variable;**


## (b)
**Calculate the coefficients of determination for the two models. Which fits the data better? Why?**


## (c)
**Use residual plots to see if the ANOVA assumptions appear reasonable for these data.**
